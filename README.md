# Frontend Starter Kit

Basic starter kit to get up and running quickly with ES6 JavaScript, LESS, and a livereload server. Useful as either minimal starting point for a single page app or as a dev environment for building a shareable frontend component such as a datepicker.

## Requirements
- node
- npm
- gulp

## Getting Started
- `npm install`
- `gulp` (compiles LESS/JS watches for changes)
- `node server` (starts the static server with livereload)
- http://localhost:3000

The starter kit comes with a bare minimum example just to demonstrate the file structure. Certain aspects of the structure can be changed by changing the `config.js` file.
